# data-working-student-challenge

## Introduction

Welcome. This challenge is focused on basic questions about Python and SQL. Please copy this repository and create a Jupyter Notebook with your solution, locally. The timeline for this challenge ends today in one week. Please send us before the timeline ends your local version of this repository. (EMAIL)

## The Data

You will find the two datasets in this repository. The first one "items" shows menu card items which where sold by our customers. Also each item has a turnover and an item_count (quantity). Please notice that the turnover is the average turnover of one item. The second dataset "tags", provide some simple information about what an item is. (e.g. beer, wine, ...)

## Tasks

The following tasks are solved with Python. Only if it's mentioned to solve in SQL, SQL should be used. The main library to use is Pandas, but you will need other libraries too.

### Task 1

Load the data and get an overview about the datasets. Please describe what you see.

### Task 2

All data preprocessing you will do should end up in this section. Maybe you can already find some problems with your dataset.

### Task 3

How many JÃ¤germeister items were sold? (Hint: regular expressions could be useful)

### Task 4

Calculate the turnover of each tag and the total turnover and sort it in descending order. For that join the datasets and describe which join should be used and why others shouldn't be used. Also please use SQL syntax via pandasql.sqldf() to solve that question.

### Task 5

What are the top 5 sold spirit items?

### Task 6

Please create a plot about the item counts of each tag.

Please do not create a pull request or fork this repository as your solution should not end up being public afterwards. If you have questions, please reach out to us (EMAIL).

Good luck and happy coding!
